# Pneumonia-Detector
Machine Learning Model to detect Pneumonia in patients using X-Rays images.

The machine is trained using a deep convolutional network layer to get the significant differences between a normal patient and a patient suffering from Pneumonia.
A list of training images are shown to the machine for it to learn the differences.
